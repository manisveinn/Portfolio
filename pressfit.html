          <h2>Pressure fit box- with laser cutting</h2>
          <article>
            <p>The project was to use a CAD software to build a parametric design of a pressfit construction kit and cut it with a laser cutter. <br>
              I decided to use this project to make a box that had internal dimensions of 401 mm on all sides. I then used the box as an measuring device for a robot competition I was organizing where the maximum size of the robots was 40 cm on all sides. I used a tutorial on youtube to guide me in the design of the box. Fusion 360 from Autodesk was used in the tutorial, so I used that as well. <br>
              First I defined the parameters as is shown below. I defined them in Icelandic. <br>

              <img class="img-size1" src="img/parametrar.png" alt="Parameters used">
            <br>

              Then I started to draw the box with those parameters. Since I needed a surtain internal dimensions I defined the dimension I needed and then added the thickness of the material used, which was 4 mm. So for example I defined the length of the box as Lengd (length) + Þykkt (thickness). <br>
              Then I started to draw the fingers for the joints. <br>

              <img class="img-size1" src="img/einnfingur.png" alt="pressure fit first finger">

              Then I used the rectangular pattern command to make the rest of the fingers for that side. <br>

              <img class="img-size1" src="img/fleirifingur.png" alt="pressure fit finger joints">

              Then I drew the next side and then used the combine command to use the fingers of the first side to cut the fingers into the 2nd plate. <br>

              <img class="img-size1" src="img/combine.png" alt="combine command to create slots">

              And similarly I made the rest of the box as the render shows.
              <br>
              <img class="img-size1" src="img/inventormynd.png" alt="render">

              Then I exported each side as dxf files and meant to import it into Inkscape to process it for the laser cutting but Inkscape didn’t accept the dxf files. Therefore I downloaded QCad and used that to change the dxf files to svg format. QCad added a few lines into the sketches but it was easy to remove them in Inkscape. <br>
              Since the box was so big I could only fit two sides on the plates I used to cut it from. So in Inkscape I put two sides together in twice and then the fifth side was alone. I wanted to make the box see through so I googled patterns to cut out of the wood. I eventually found a so called Voronoi pattern which I imported and used on all sides. Also I wrote “Hönnunarkeppni HÍ” on the top side of the box which is the name of the competition I made the box for. The laser cutter then rastered that into the wood. <br>
              Below is a snap shot of the pdf file for the top and front side of the box. <br>

              <img class="img-size1" src="img/fronturtoppur.png" alt="inkscape">

              The box didn’t end up being a pressure fit. That was because in the drawing the fingers and the slots for the fingers were the exact same size and since the laser cutter cuts away about 0,02 mm of material, that meant that the slots were slightly bigger than the fingers. This could have been fixed for example in Inkscape by widening the fingers by offsetting the appropriate lines. <br><br>
              Links to the tutorials I used and the voronoi pattern can be found below. <br>
